1. Most Reserve Banks have at least one Branch, and each Branch has its own board of directors. A majority of the directors on a Branch board are appointed by the Reserve Bank, and the remaining Branch directors are appointed by the Board of Governors. Pursuant to Board policy, Board-appointed Branch directors cannot be affiliated with a bank or with certain other types of supervised financial institutions; however, Reserve Bank-appointed Branch directors may be bankers.
