Coupa Supplier Enablement
Starting on July 5, 2023,
the Board will utilize a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based solution provided by Coupa. Coupa is a cloud-based SaaS spend management platform that unifies the procure-to-pay business process.
All transactions with Board suppliers will be managed through the Coupa platform in the Coupa Supplier Portal (CSP). This configuration will enable an electronic connection and allow procure-to-pay activities to occur completely online.
Common questions and details about the enablement options are included in the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document (PDF)
.
The Coupa Supplier Training, below, can also provide some additional context and instructions on how to use the Coupa platform successfully.
