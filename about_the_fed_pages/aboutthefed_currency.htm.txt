The Federal Reserve Board's Role
As the issuing authority for all Federal Reserve notes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has a wide range of responsibilities related to paper money, from ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in our currency. Together with our partners at the
Treasury Department
Bureau of Engraving and Printing
, and the
United States Secret Service
, we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each denomination and make redesign decisions based on these threats.
U.S. Currency Website
uscurrency.gov
provides education tools allowing users to explore all the designs and denominations of Federal Reserve notes. The site features new resources including a training module for cash handlers, a quick reference guide for authenticating currency at the point of sale, and animated educational videos.
