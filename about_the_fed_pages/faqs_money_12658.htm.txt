Informing the public about the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve has very limited authority to provide financial assistance to state or local governments. The Fed believes that because this type of activity inherently involves political considerations, the Congress and the Administration are better suited to make decisions and take actions that would provide assistance to state and local governments.
